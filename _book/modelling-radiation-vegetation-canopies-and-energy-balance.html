<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>This chapter deals with upscaling processes from leaf level to canopy level, but still on a (very) short timescale (~hours, sub-daily).</p>
<p>We want a model that is consistent over different scales. If we measure parameters at the leaf level and put those parameter values in our model, we want the results to be as consistent as possible with the data at the canopy scale, for example data from eddy covariance flux towers. Also the other way around, if we optimize model parameters based on flux tower measurements, we want the resulting leaf parameters to be as close as possible to the parameters observed in the field at leaf level.</p>
<p>We first refresh some basics on radiation. The sun emits shortwave radiation, the earth emits longwave radiation (invisible). Longwave radiation has its maximum intensity at a much longer wavelength and contains a much lower amount of energy (surface under the spectral intensity curve). The spectrum of wavelengths the sun emits is different when we measure it on the earth surface (compared to the spectrum at the top of the atmosphere, as the atmosphere absorbs some of the radiation, e.g.Â in the ultraviolet light and infrared light absorption takes place. Diffuse radiation (which indirectly reaches the surface) is more shifted towards the blue light, which is one of the wavelengths used by plants. On a sunny day, both diffuse and direct radiation reach the plants. Under full cloud cover, plants only receive diffuse radiation. 50% of the shortwave radiation is PAR (Photosynthetic Active radiation). PAR is typically expressed as a photon flux density (micromols of photons per mÂ² per s). The lower the zenith angle (higher sun), the higher the PAR fraction in the diffuse and direct radiation that reaches the earth surface. The relative PAR fraction is higher in diffuse radiation.</p>
<p>Secondly, we need to refresh some basics on canopy structure parameters. The leaf area index (LAI) is the total leaf area per unit of ground area. Sometimes it is also defined as the total double-sided surface of the leaves (so the two sides of the leaf), but this is not commonly used. The projected leaf area depends on the orientation of the leaf. Vertically oriented leaves have a smaller projected leaf area than if they would be horizontally oriented. Figure <a href="modelling-radiation-vegetation-canopies-and-energy-balance.html#fig:f31">3.1</a> shows a generalized example of the leaf area density distribution for different vegetation types. The peak of leaf area density is different depending on the vegetation type, with a peak higher in the vegetation for forests and more in the middle for grass. The total LAI is calculated by integrating the function <span class="math inline">\(a(z)\)</span> showed in figure <a href="modelling-radiation-vegetation-canopies-and-energy-balance.html#fig:f31">3.1</a> over the height. If you keep in mind that trees are higher than grass, it is clear that the total LAI will be bigger for trees than for grass.</p>

<p>The cumulative LAI represented in Figure <a href="modelling-radiation-vegetation-canopies-and-energy-balance.html#fig:f32">3.2</a> shows the LAI above a certain point in the canopy. It is calculated as the integral of the function between that point and the canopy height. This figure also shows the cumulative wood area index. If we make the sum of the LAI and the wood area index (WAI) we get the plant area index PAI, which is the total area of plant material per unit of ground area.</p>

<p>The leaf angle (distribution) is a key structural property of a vegetation canopy. It will largely determine how light will penetrate in the canopy, and is important for other processes, like precipitation interception. Figure <a href="modelling-radiation-vegetation-canopies-and-energy-balance.html#fig:f33">3.3</a> illustrates that the leaf angle can be expressed as the angle between the leaf and the horizontal plane, or as the angle between the zenith line and the line perpendicular to the leaf surface.</p>

<p>Leaf angle distributions describe a probability density function of leaf angles of a plant or vegetation. Base on these distribution we can distinguish differences between plants and vegetation types. Planophile leaf angle distributions: most leaves are horizontally oriented; erectophile: most leaves are vertically oriented; plagiophile: average leaf inclination angle is 45Â°; spherical: mostly used in modelling, corresponds somehow to erectophile, it is a kind of idealized form. This distributions are illustrated in Fig. <a href="modelling-radiation-vegetation-canopies-and-energy-balance.html#fig:f34">3.4</a> Subplot b indicates the cumulative distribution of the leaves.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="modelling-radiation-vegetation-canopies-and-energy-balance.html#fig:f35">3.5</a> illustrates the impact of leaf orientation in two crops on light penetration in the canopy of two crops (lower panel). The complexity of the vegetation plays an important role in where the light is intercepted and how much is intercepted (upper panel). In an erectophile leaf orientation, the light interception is more evenly spread through the vegetation than for a planophile profile, where most of the interception takes place at the center of the vegetation.</p>

<p>Light extinction follows a typical exponential course when it is observed at multiple heights in vegetation, it decreases very fast at the top of the canopy, with almost no light reaching the soil in this example (Fig. <a href="modelling-radiation-vegetation-canopies-and-energy-balance.html#fig:f36">3.6</a>).
We can conclude that radiative transfer in the canopy depends on:</p>

<p>Radiative transfer theory aims to integrate the light environment of individual vegetation elements (leaves, branches, â¦) over the entire canopy. It must distinguish between the specific behavior of direct beam radiation and omnidirectional diffuse radiation and it should account for wavelength.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Radiative transfer modelling</h2>
<p>Radiative transfer modelling in full 3D is very complex and is a separate branch of science. The radiative transfer schemes in vegetation models are usually relatively simple approximations of full 3D radiative transfer. Such schemes have a lot of assumptions: all leaves are plane-parallel oriented, leaf layers are horizontally homogeneous. We mostly use a one dimensional representation of the canopy (Fig.<a href="modelling-radiation-vegetation-canopies-and-energy-balance.html#fig:f37">3.7</a>), which is often used in vegetation models. Such an approach neglects the horizontal heterogeneity of vegetation and only assume a simplified vertical heterogeneity. A more complex model, subplot b, represents a three dimensional representation of the canopy, with vertical and horizontal variation.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Leaf optical properties</h3>
<p>What happens to light when it reaches a leaf? It can be absorbed, reflected or transmitted. We express these in relative fractions as <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> = reflectance (albedo), <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> = transmittance, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> = absorbance. Leaves absorb PAR, with a small negative peak at the green light, which they reflect more compared to blue and red light. Also in the infrared wavelength band, radiation is absorbed (mostly longwave radiation). UV light is absorbed by the cuticula to protect the leaves. The reflectance and transmittance curves are inverse curves from the absorptance curve. Here, infrared radiation and green light are reflected/transmitted. The clear difference between VIS and NIR is used in remote sensing for vegetation indices (e.g.Â NDVI). Transmittance depends on the thickness of the leave.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> Light transmission without scattering</h3>
<p>The most basic radiative transfer models, do not consider scattering (no reflection on the leaf). The Beer-Bouguer-Lambert law describes the attenuation of light through a homogeneous medium with thickness <span class="math inline">\(dz\)</span> in absence of scattering. The absorbed radiation is proportional to the thickness of the medium, the amount of light that comes in and a constant <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>.</p>

<p>After integration we can calculate the radiation <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> leaving the medium from <span class="math inline">\(I_0\)</span>, the radiation intensity entering the medium.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[

<p>For leaves in a canopy, and based on probability theory, Monsi and Saeki (1953) applied the Beer law for a volume with crown thickness <span class="math inline">\(dz\)</span>, with randomly distributed horizontal elements (leaves) with density <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> (number of elements per volume, see Fig. <a href="modelling-radiation-vegetation-canopies-and-energy-balance.html#fig:f39">3.9</a>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[

<p>The above described formulas do not only allow us to describe the light extinction in the canopy, but also to calculate the sun and shaded fraction of leaf are in the canopy. If we divide the canopy into multiple layers, we can calculate for each layer which part is in the sun and which part is in the shade. For every canopy layer, the fraction of sunlit leaves is equal to the fsun(x) function. It represents the amount of light that comes through the layers above it.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f_{sun} (x) = e^{-K_b x}
\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is the cumulative LAI above the layer of interest. Similarly we can calculate the actual sunlit leaf area within a certain layer:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\Delta L_{sun} = \frac{e^{-K_b x} \left(1 - e^{-K_b \Delta L} \right)}{K_b}
\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta L\)</span> is the actual amount of leaves in that layer, this formula calculates the difference between the sunlit fraction at the top of the layer minus the âreduction of sunlit fractionâ within the layer. If we apply that formula on a full canopy we can calculate the sunlit leaf area of the full canopy <span class="math inline">\(L_{sun}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
L_{sun} = \frac{\left(1 - e^{-K_b L} \right)}{K_b}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(L_{sun}\)</span>: integrated over the whole canopy. Based on this equation you can calculated the amount of leaves that is sunlit in the canopy. And also the shade fraction based on the difference with the total LAI.</p>
<p>In the example below (Fig. <a href="modelling-radiation-vegetation-canopies-and-energy-balance.html#fig:f313">3.13</a>) the sunlit and total LAI are compared between a vegetation with horizontal and with vertical foliage. The latter has more sunlit leaves, as top leaves donât shade the underlaying leaves. In the horizontal foliage, more light is absorbed, so less light is transmitted than in the vertical foliage.</p>

<p>When we study the sunlit LAI with increasing cumulative LAI (Fig.<a href="modelling-radiation-vegetation-canopies-and-energy-balance.html#fig:f314">3.14</a>) for different leaf orientations, the same course of the curve applies: first, there is a linear increase of the amount sunlit leave are index with increasing LAI, after which a saturation occurs when the vegetation becomes more dense (higher LAI). The level of saturation depends on the leaf angle distribution.</p>

<p>A final complicating factor that we want to highlight here is that leaves and canopies are not distributed randomly in space, but occur clumped. Leaf clumping means that leaves appear in groups and that there are larger gaps in between. Clumping can occur at different scales: at leaf level, canopy level or landscape level (Fig.<a href="modelling-radiation-vegetation-canopies-and-energy-balance.html#fig:f315">3.15</a>). The clumping factor (<span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>) adjusts the amount of light that goes through the vegetation (more light passes through). The factor is added in the radiation extinction equations to adjust the extinction coefficient. Where a clumping factor of 1 represents randomly distributed leaves, while values lower then 1 represent clumped leaves (e.g.Â 0.74 for needleleaf evergreen forest).</p>

<p>Big leaf models can have a shaded and a sunlit fraction in the canopy, or can consider sunlit leaves only. The forest/vegetation is represented as one big leaf, with a leaf area equal to the total leaf area of the forest/vegetation. Such models do not account for the vertical structure of the canopy. These models calculate properties of the big leaf, by upscaling. For example by caluculating an average stomatal or caopy conductance. Evapotranspiration can then be calculated by applying the Penman-Monteith equation and a canopy level conductance. The leaf boundary layer is replaced by the atmosphere surface layer and gsw is the average stomatal conductance of the whole forest.</p>

<p>It is not an easy task to integrate GPP (e.g.Â calculated by the Farquhar model of Chapter 2) over a canopy represented by a big leaf. We cannot just give the total light absorbed by the canopy to a photosynthesis model, as we need to account for the non-linearity in the process. The task is easier if Amax is assumed to decrease exponentially together with light availability I the canopy, which is a reasonable assumption, as we know that leaf nitrogen content is decreasing from the top to the bottom of the canopy. As such we are assuming a âphotosynthesis extinctionâ" instead of a light extinction in the canopy.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
GPP = \int_0^LA(x)dx
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
A_{max}(x) = A_{max0}e^{-K_bx}

<p><span class="math display">\[
GPP = \int_0^{L}A(x)dx = A(0) \left[\frac{1 - e^{-K_b L}}{K_b} \right]
\]</span></p>
<p>However, this is a rough approach, and it does not account for the nonlinear canopy responses. A better approach is to include a sunlit and shade fraction of the leaves. Where the GPP is calculated as the sum for sunlit and shaded leaves separately. Each fraction has a separate value for <span class="math inline">\(g_s\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A_m\)</span> etcâ¦</p>

<p>3D ray tracing models are not (yet) use as part of operational vegetation models. They rather for a separate group of models, focus on radiative transfer only (they do not simulate other processes such as photosynthesis). These models are typically used to simulate what a satellite (or other remote sensing sensor) would observe in specific wavelength bands. As such these models are very useful for interpretation of remote sensing observations. They really simulate how light, or individual sun rays penetrate the canopy and do that for the different wavelengths.

<p>This is the central equation of the surface energy balance:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[

<p>The net radiation is the input of energy to the ecosystem which is dissipated via multiple loss terms: latent heat (evapotranspiration), sensible heat flux, ground heat flux and energy storage (in the biomass of the ecosystem). Most of the energy goes to the latent heat to well-watered active vegetation (e.g.Â a beach forest in summer).</p>
<p>It is really important to close the energy balance in models. All factors in the equation can be formulated in terms of input factors of the model, such as incoming radiation, and in function of the surface temperature. The equation below is rewriting the above equation in terms of surface temperature.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[

<p>How is the amount of diffuse light impacting photosynthesis? (diffuse radiation fertilization) In normal circumstances, the sun leaves are in the saturated zone of photosynthesis, while shaded leaves are somewhere on the linear increase part. If you would change the radiation composition (e.g.Â more clouds), this would result in less light for the sunlit leaves, which has only limited impact on their photosynthesis. For the shaded leaves on the other hand, more diffuse radiation has a big impact on the photosynthesis. So, the hypothesis in this study is that if you have more diffuse radiation, more photosynthesis takes place at the canopy level. This hypothesis is tested by using data of two fluxtower stations and a multilayer vegetation model.</p>

Photosynthesis increases with increasing diffuse radiation an reaches a maximum at 45% diffuse light. Transpiration increases also but at a slower pace, and the water use efficiency increases faster. So, forests have a higher water use efficiency when the amount of diffuse radiation is higher (again with max but now around 0.65). On cloudy days the Rd/Rs is higher than the optimum. The net carbon balance increased if you have more diffuse light (in relative terms), the transpiration remains stable but the WUE is increasing (more photosynthesis for the same amount of transpiration). However, for the studied sites, the situation is in 61% of the time beyond the optimum (on cloudy days), resulting in a net decreasing impact on the net carbon uptake.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.2</span> Case study 3.2</h3>
<p>Studies have shown that the increase of atmospheric CO2 since the 1850âs caused an enhancement in plant growth, but the magnitude varies. This enhancement also manifests itself in the enhancement of LAI (leaf area index), the area of leafs on a specific ground area.
In the paper, Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) was used as process-based diagnostic model. It initially was used, as the name states, for boreal ecosystems, but has been adapted for all ecosystems on Earth. It simulates the impact of drivers (climate, CO2 concentration, and nitrogen deposition) on the GPP (Gross Primary Production) and as well carbon pools below GPP and respiration activities, generally, the whole carbon cycle, this on a daily time interval for each pixel. It makes use of various satellite data (assimilate LAI) and LUE (light-use efficiency) models.</p>
<p>Running these simulations on three LAI series, it stated that the enhancement of LAI contributed 12,4% to the accumulated carbon sink.
In satellite observations it was observed that the global leaf area index has increased over the past 40 years, and they wanted to investigate whether this has had an effect on global carbon sink. The model used in this study is driven by remote sensing data, it is a diagnostic and not really a process-based model. The model calculates the GPP based on the equation (seen today) which used LAIshade and LAIsun based on similar equation with exponential function, clumping factor and so on. The study aims to quantify how much the LAI increase is contributing to the simulated carbon uptake globally.
Map shows the trends of the LAI in the world.</p>

<p>They calculated the different factors which are accounted for in their model and tested how sensitive their model result was to that different driving factors. According to the model, global ecosystem productivity has increased (light blue line in Fig. <a href="modelling-radiation-vegetation-canopies-and-energy-balance.html#fig:f335">3.35</a>). N deposition did not a net effect. Climate change (T increase, drought stress) has reduced the sink strength. The LAI increase had a positive impact, contributes to the increased sink.
They observed that the relative increase of the maximum LAI per year was larger than the relative increase of the average LAI per year. This indicates that the average LAI increase is mainly caused by the higher maximum LAI, and not by the lengthening of the growing season.</p>
