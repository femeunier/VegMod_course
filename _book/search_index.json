(Bonan) Earth System Models and climate models (Fig 1.1 Bonan). In climate models vegetation is just representing physical fluxes, in ESM vegetation is representing biogeochemical cycles, biogeography, and dynamic vegetation  typically the realm of ecosystem models Land component continuum of terrestrial ecosystem models (vegetation models) (Fig 1.7) 1.2 test title dzhezuehziufhilzuf 1.3 Why do we need modelling? Devising suitable solutions to these global change challenges require not only strong empirically and experimentally based research at the local scale to understand how ecosystems are structured and how they function, but also sound theoretical foundations to generalize this understanding to regional, continental, and global scales and to make projections of the future. Computer models of terrestrial ecosystems are essential to this generalization. (Bonan) For prediction: study system behavior in conditions beyond which measurements can be made; to allow predictions of system behavior, especially in response to some imposed perturbation; and to inform management and policy decisions. These usages of models are particularly important in the context ofglobal change. For understanding: a formal organization of understanding; it originates from the knowledge of its developers about how the system operates. One purpose of modeling, then, is to identify the processes needed to adequately simulate the system. If a model replicates some observations, a scientist must ask why the model works correctly. If the model performs poorly, then the scientist must ask what is missing. It is testing hypotheses, just like you do with physical experiments. For data integration: to organize and link data in a structure way, as a research tool to guide data collection. What are the critical parameters that need to be measured? How precisely must these parameters be measured to reduce model uncertainty? What new observations are needed to test the model? In this context, models inform data collection and experimental design to both test the model and advance process understanding. 1.4 Model types continuum of terrestrial ecosystem models, from models with emphasis on biogeochemical pools and fluxes, dynamic vegetation models with focus on individual plants or size cohorts, canopy models with focus on coupling leaf physiological processes with canopy physics, and global models of the land surface for climate simulation. (Table 1.1, Bonan) Continuum of empirical to process-based models Types of vegetation models (depending on the purpose, questions, scales) (e.g. timber, yield, biogeochemistry, ) (ecologists, foresters, climatologist, atmospheric chemists, hydrologist all have different vegetation models) Compare vegetation models to for example species distribution models 1.5 The history of vegetation models Conceptualisation of ecosystem to mass and energy flows among various compartments (refer to ecology course of Steppe in the Bio-ir Bachelors. box models in the 1960s and 1970s current global biogeochemical models are still box-type of models (Fig 1.4) In parallel individual based models of forest dynamics were developed, based on population dynamics, life cycle of species. They are also called gap models that simulate the demography in an area of 0.1 ha (size of a gap in the canopy) (Fig 1.5). Ecosystem properties such as carbon stocks are emerging from the demography simulation. More recently cohort based models DGVMs: These models also simulate changes in community composition, biomass, productivity, and nutrient cycling. Because the models are applied globally, they do not recognize individual species. Rather, they employ plant functional types, Table 1.2 Fig 1.2 Bonan 1.6 Components of a model Table 1.3 and Table 1.4 Model structure (constraints: resolving of fluxes on short time scales, conservation of mass and energy, Parameters i/o variables, state variable time steps (fluxes must be resolved on a short time interval, diurnal cycles) spatial structure (Fig 1.11) Prognostic equations use time derivatives to describe the change in a state variable and are integrated forward in time from some initial condition. Prognostic variables must be numerically stepped forward from time n to n + 1 over the time interval deltat. Conservation equations Diagnostic equations (e.g. ideal gas law) linking variables time-independent Initial conditions Model code, There is an enormous leap between seeing a mathematical equation in a research paper and actually using that equation in a model (Bonan Book).

In Bonan: CASA-CNP model 5.2.1 Model structure Biogeochemical models simulate processes of allocation of photosynthetic carbon gain to plant parts (e.g., foliage, fine root, wood), turnover of plant biomass as litterfall, transformation of litter to soil organic matter, and carbon loss during respiration. Principles: - net carbon input is equal to gross primary production minus autotrophic respiration; - carbon flows from donor to receiver pools at a rate that depends on the donor pool size and its chemical quality as modified by the environment; - mass balance is maintained as carbon flows through the system of interconnected pools; - decay of litter and soil organic matter releases CO 2 as heterotrophic respiration. Models: a system of first-order, linear differential equations to describe carbon pools and fluxes (typically time step of one day) Pools and fluxes to be included: - Carbon gain from gross primary production minus autotrophic respiration - Allocation of carbon to growth of leaves, wood, and roots pools (partitioning varies with light availability, soil temperature, soil moisture, and nutrients + temporal for leaves (ref to phenology) - Carbon turnover (comprising litterfall, background mortality, and disturbances) + turnover rates depending on the plant material - litter pools: metabolic litter, structural litter, coarse woody debris (vary in chemical quality and turnover rate; base turnover rates are modified for soil temperature and soil moisture (environmental scaling factors)) - decomposition to soil organic matter pools: fast SOM, slow SOM, passive SOM (vary in chemical quality and turnover time) - portion of the decomposition flow lost as heterotrophic respiration Bonan - Figure 17.2: structure of a typical biogeochemical model - equations 17.1  17.10 Additional details? - maintenance respiration and growth respiration - storage pool of nonstructural carbohydrates - some models separate wood into live stems (sapwood) and dead stems, roots into fine roots and coarse roots, and coarse roots into live pools and dead pools to account for the different physiological functioning of these biomass components 5.2.2 Allocation and turnover parameterization types of allocation models (see Campioli et al 2013 and work of Fatichi et al. ) allocation parameters fixed allocation and dynamic allocation (specified by biome or based on environmental conditions) Optimality models: plants optimally allocate resources to balance light acquisition (foliage), structural support and water transport (stems), and water and nutrient uptake (roots). allocation based on scaling relationships among plant components (specified ratios of foliage, root, and wood biomass) Turnover rates vary depending on plant material and are specified as a fraction of biomass. Turnover rates are commonly estimated as the inverse of residence time or longevity biogeochemical models can be applied to any type of ecosystem such as grassland, savanna, forest, shrubland, and tundra 5.3 Nutrient cycle models: soil biogeochemical models 5.3.1 Nitrogen cycle Bonan Chapter 17.6 Nitrogen Cycle Bonan Figure 17.8: Depiction of the nitrogen cycle only ~recently added in most biogeochemical models closely coupled to carbon cycle important role to limit plant productivity similar to carbon with an associated nitrogen pool and transfer. cycling of nitrogen can be represented by a system of linear differential equations similar to that for carbon. allocation of plant nitrogen uptake up to plant pools loss of nitrogen in litterfall + portion is reabsorbed soil nitrogen cycle is more complex (various forms) decomposition of litter and soil organic matter, (mineralization and immobilization) nitrification, denitrification, leaching, ammonia volatilization additional inputs from biological nitrogen fixation, atmospheric deposition, and fertilizer some examples of models?

Each tree is characterized by its species, stem diameter, height, and age. trees compete for light, soil moisture, and nutrients. patch undergoes temporal changes in the density, size, and composition of trees with the formation of a gap in the canopy Community composition, biomass, productivity, and biogeochemical cycles are emergent outcomes of individual trees interacting among themselves and with the environment to acquire the resources necessary for growth and survival cohort-based models define patches based on age since disturbance and simulate the dynamics of cohorts of similar plant functional types rather than tracking every individual.
