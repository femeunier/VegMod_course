# Upscaling from leaf and tree to the globe
\chaptermark{Globe}
 - Scalling processes and problems, Jarvis 1995
 - upscalling in global change research, Harvey 2000
 
## Land surface models
- Dependence to other disciplines (Biology, ecology, physics, chemistry (VOC, etc), hydrology, pedology, datascience and mathematics, etcâ€¦)
- Figure 1.7 from Bonan
- UCL 4.2: Land surface schemes
- 
### Spatial and temporal non-linearities: Cascading effect in the Earth system
- spatial upscalling
- temporal upscalling
- classification of upscalling problems:
  - Spatial variability + process nonlinearity
  - Minimim scale to observe the process
  - Different processes dominate at different scales
  - Feedbacks between scales
  - Development of emergent properties
  - Edge effects
  - Temporal lag dependent on spatial scale change
  - Collective response with differential effects
- Solutions to upscaling problems: 
  - Ignore
  - Increase model resolution
  - etc... ** Nice review in Harvey 2000 **

### Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere-Transer models

## DVGMs as a part of Earth System Models
- Partially in UCL 4.3.3
### One Biosphere
- Chapter 1 of Bonan, specifically 1.5
- Coupling to other components
- 
### Atmosphere, Ocean, lakes and urban areas
- Rapid desciption of other models
