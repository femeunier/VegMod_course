### Multilayer models

(a) Diffuse and direct beam solar radiation is transmitted or intercepted. The intercepted portion is absorbed or scattered in the forward and backward direction. Longwave radiation is similar to diffuse radiation. (b) Leaf sensible heat, transpiration, and CO2 fluxes depend on absorbed radiation and leaf boundary layer and stomatal conductances. Sensible heat is exchanged from both sides of the leaf. Water vapor and CO2 can be exchanged from one or both sides of the leaf depending on stomata. Leaf temperature is the temperature that balances the energy budget. (c) Stomatal conductance depends on leaf water potential. Plant water uptake for a canopy layer is in relation to belowground soil and root conductance and aboveground stem conductance acting in series and also a capacitance term. See Figure 13.4a for more details. (d) Scalar profiles are calculated from a conductance network. Leaf fluxes provide the source or sink of heat, water vapor, and CO2, along with soil fluxes. (e) Sensible heat, latent heat, and heat storage in soil depend on the ground temperature that balances the soil energy budget. (f) The wetted fraction of the canopy layer depends on the portion of precipitation that is intercepted. (Bonan)', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center',echo=FALSE}
