## Vegetation models as part of earth system models

```{r f93, fig.cap='Scientific scope of (a) climate models and (b) Earth system models. Climate models simulate biogeophysical fluxes of energy, water, and momentum on land and also the hydrologic cycle. Terrestrial and marine biogeochemical cycles are new processes in Earth system models. The terrestrial carbon cycle includes carbon uptake through gross primary production (GPP) and carbon loss from autotrophic respiration, heterotrophic respiration, and wildfire. Many models also include the nitrogen cycle. Anthropogenic land use and land-cover change are additional processes. The fluxes of CO2, CH4, aerosols, biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), and wildfire chemical emissions are passed to the atmosphere to simulate atmospheric chemistry and composition. Nitrogen is carried in freshwater runoff to the ocean.(Bonan)', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center',echo=FALSE}

## Case study 9.1


```{r f98, fig.cap='Carbon fluxes in CTL and experiment A. a, IAV (inter annual variability) in global mean NBP as simulated by four ESMs (CCSM4, ECHAM6, GFDL and IPSL) in coupled model experiments with (CTL) and without (experiment A; ExpA) anomalies in soil moisture. Positive NBP indicates carbon uptake. b, Standard deviations of global mean NBP, GPP and respiration and disturbance (ReD) in the two experiments. c, Drivers of change in global mean NBP variance. Global mean NBP variance decreases in the experiment with prescribed seasonal soil moisture mainly because GPP variance is reduced. GPP and ReD fluxes are not available for the IPSL model.
