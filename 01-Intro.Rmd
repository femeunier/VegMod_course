# Introduction {#intro}
## Soil-plant-atmosphere continuum: the central role of vegetation in the earth system
- Global change context
- Terrestrial ecosystems are central to solving the environmental and socioeconomic threats posed by changes in climate, atmospheric composition, and air quality; land use and land-cover change; habitat loss, species extinction, and invasive species; appropriation of freshwater, net primary production, and other ecosystems goods and services for human uses; and anthropogenic addition of reactive nitrogen. (Bonan)
- Earth System Models and climate models (Fig 1.1 Bonan). In climate models vegetation is just representing physical fluxes, in ESM vegetation is representing biogeochemical cycles, biogeography, and dynamic vegetation – typically the realm of ecosystem models
- Land component  continuum of terrestrial ecosystem models (vegetation models) (Fig 1.7)

## Why do we need modelling?
- Devising suitable solutions to these global change challenges require not only strong empirically and experimentally based research at the local scale to understand how ecosystems are structured and how they function, but also sound theoretical foundations to generalize this understanding to regional, continental, and global scales and to make projections of the future. Computer models of terrestrial ecosystems are essential to this generalization. (Bonan)
- For prediction: study system behavior in conditions beyond which measurements can be made; to allow predictions of system behavior, especially in response to some imposed perturbation; and to inform management and policy decisions. These usages of models are particularly important in the context ofglobal change.
- For understanding: a formal organization of understanding; it originates from the knowledge of its developers about how the system operates. One purpose of modeling, then, is to identify the processes needed to adequately simulate the system. If a model replicates some observations, a scientist must ask why the model works correctly. If the model performs poorly, then the scientist
must ask what is missing. It is testing hypotheses, just like you do with physical experiments. 
- For data integration: to organize and link data in a structure way,  as a research tool to guide data collection. What are the critical parameters that need to be measured? How precisely must these parameters be measured to reduce model uncertainty? What new observations are needed to test the model? In this context, models inform data collection and experimental design to both test the model and advance process understanding.

## Model types
- continuum of terrestrial ecosystem models, from models with emphasis on biogeochemical pools and fluxes, dynamic vegetation models with focus on individual plants or size cohorts, canopy models with focus on coupling leaf physiological processes with canopy physics, and global models of the land surface for climate simulation. (Table 1.1, Bonan)
- Continuum of empirical to process-based models
- Types of vegetation models (depending on the purpose, questions, scales) (e.g. timber, yield, biogeochemistry, …) (ecologists, foresters, climatologist, atmospheric chemists, hydrologist all have different vegetation models…)
- Compare vegetation models to for example species distribution models…
- Describe the difference between empirical and process-based modelling (including semi-empirical)

## The history of vegetation models
- Conceptualisation of ecosystem to mass and energy flows among various compartments  (refer to ecology course of Steppe in the Bio-ir Bachelors.  ‘box models in the 1960’s and 1970’s  current global biogeochemical models are still box-type of models (Fig 1.4)
- In parallel individual based models of forest dynamics were developed, based on population dynamics, life cycle of species. They are also called “gap models” that simulate the demography in an area of 0.1 ha (size of a gap in the canopy) (Fig 1.5). Ecosystem properties such as carbon stocks are emerging from the demography simulation.
- More recently  cohort based models
- DGVMs: These models also simulate changes in community composition, biomass, productivity, and nutrient cycling. Because the models are applied globally, they do not recognize individual species. Rather, they employ plant functional types, Table 1.2

## Components of a model
- Table 1.3 and Table 1.4
- Model structure (constraints: resolving of fluxes on short time scales, conservation of mass and energy, 
- Parameters
- i/o variables, state variable
- time steps (fluxes must be resolved on a short time interval, diurnal cycles) 
- spatial structure (Fig 1.11)
- Prognostic equations use time derivatives to describe the change in a state variable and are integrated forward in time from some initial condition. Prognostic variables must be numerically stepped forward from time n to n + 1 over the time interval dt.
- Conservation equations
- Diagnostic equations (e.g. ideal gas law) linking variables time-independent
- Initial conditions
- Model code, There is an enormous leap between seeing a mathematical equation in a research paper and actually using that equation in a model (Bonan Book).
- Model uncertainty and complexity (fig 1.12) (+ fig from Dietze book)

## Structure of the course
- a science that spans boundary layer meteorology, micrometeorology, atmospheric chemistry, plant physiology, ecosystem ecology, biogeochemistry, soil science, hydrology, and geochemistry …  we will not discuss all the basics in this course, but we expect you to know from other courses (Ecology, plant physiology, forestry, hydrology, soil science …), but we will of course go into the processes, but focus on there mathematical formulation and translation into a workin model (code)
- progression through the course (space-time figure, with chapters)
- Model development cycle (structure for the methodological focus of each application/practical) (Dietze figure)

**to test: Idea of a conceptual figure that we will build block by block as we go deeper in the course. It represents the concept that vegetation modelling is to have an integrated representation of the plant functioning and all the underlying processes at different scales. **
