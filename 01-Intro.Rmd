# Introduction {#intro}
## The central role of vegetation in the Earth system

Plants and vegetation play an essential role in the earth system. In Figure \@ref(fig:f1), we have represented the planetary boundaries and the significant environmental challenges we are facing. For some of them, we are reaching the system's boundary, such as genetic diversity, biogeochemical cycling, and climate change. Plants and forest ecosystems are critical in multiple of these planetary problems. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how vegetation reacts to environmental problems (positive or negative feedback).

```

A more specific example is the global carbon budget. We are currently facing this significant change in biogeochemical cycling due to the rising fossil fuel emission over the last 150 years. Figure \@ref(fig:f2) represents the balance between carbon sources (fossil carbon and land-use changes) and sinks (oceans, land, and atmosphere). The more we emit, the more the Earth system is capturing, as shown in Fig.2. This takes us to a question,  frequently addressed by global vegetation models, about how long these sinks will continue or not capture our increasing carbon emissions. It is also important to highlight the high inter annual variability of the land component being the most challenging component to predict.

```

**Climate Models** predict how the long-term weather variation and average weather will evolve. These models include an atmosphere, land and ocean component (Fig.3, top). The original climate models focused on biophysics: energy and water balances, predicting precipitation, radiation and fluxes between the three components.
More recently, climate models have evolved into **Earth System Models** (ESM). ESM have a more complex concept because they represents more processes (Fig.3, bottom). Why? If you want to predict the end of the century climate, we need to consider greenhouse gases and thus the full carbon cycle. ESM are more complex but also more realistic.

```

Vegetation models are often the land component of an earth system model. These 'terrestrial biosphere models'(TBM) or 'land surface models' (LSM)

- simulate **energy fluxes**: radiation, evapotranspiration and sensible heat fluxes between the land and the atmosphere. Depending on the vegetation type, the impacts are different.
- simulate the **hydrology** and the **carbon cycle**.
- simulate slower processes like **vegetation dynamics**: the succession of forest or **land use** and **urbanization**.

```

The biosphere acts as a coupler in earth system models. The coupler is a system that links different models. The vegetation provides the link between land and atmosphere component.


## Why do we need modelling?

Modelling has proven to be a essential tool:

- For **understanding**: we need good theoretical foundations (understand processes) to generalize knowledge and observations in space and time (upscaling). Studying the inaccuraies in models leads to the formulation of new hypotheses.
- For **prediction**, how vegetation responds to expected changes (temperature or CO2) to develop management strategies and policies.
- For **data integration**: a framework to bring together multiple data sources and to guide future data collection.

## Model types

How can we look at the different model types that exist (Table \@ref(table:example))? We can divide model types into empirical models or process-based models. **Empirical models** are based on data and correlations, not describing precisely the biophysical processes — **process-based models** describing the biophysical processes and causal relations between the variables (Table \@ref(table:empirical)). Most existing vegetation models are hybrid.

```

The model type depends on:
- Purpose: will it be used for management support, policy support, research.
- Question: different people will be interested in different questions (foresters, ecologists, policy makers…)
- Scale: models that are to be applied for local use can be much more detailed than worldwide models because data gathering is much more straightforward on a small scale. Also the time-scale is of importance: will the model be used for research about the past, the present or the future? 


## The history of vegetation models

The first vegetation models have emerged in the 1960s and 1970s. There were some parallel evolutions during that time because of computers emerging, making it possible to study more complex systems. 

One of the first models were the **box models** (1960); these models describe the flow of mass and energy through boxes. These models still exist in current biogeochemical models, where arrows represent the fluxes between the pools. In parallel, **gap models** had emerged. Gap models simulate the dynamics of the development of a gap in a forest and the growth of plants in this gap. Gaps can be created by fallen trees, by dead trees, … . This kind of models are individual-based and focused on population dynamics and the life cycle of species: growth, regeneration and mortality while taking environmental constraints in account. These models are the first models that were ever used for upscaling: from tree level, to plot-level, to landscape level. They were developed by forest scientists using forest inventories to derive  growth, regeneration, and mortality in response to environmental variables. 
In 1973, the first model (MIAMI model) was developed to derive global net primary productivity (NPP), relating NPP in an empirical way to climate variables (temperature) with vegetation productivity. This was the first attempt to make a global upscaling of a vegetation process. 
In the 1980s surged the first **land surface models**. Land surface models are the models where the other models start to integrate into, and evolved as such into – **Terrestrial biosphere models** (see Figure \@ref(fig:f7)), which are now the state-of-the-art land components of ESMs.
Vegetation modelling therefore is a very interdisciplinary field because it involves knowledge of different scientific fields, making it difficult to find a common terminology. Global EMS are currently still not good to simulate realistic vegetation dynamics.

## Components of a model

What is a vegetation model?
Two attempts for a definition:

- **Dynamic global vegetation models** (DGVMs) are powerful tools to project past, current and future vegetation patterns and associated biogeochemical cycles (Scheiter et al., 2013).
- A **Dynamic Global Vegetation Model** (DGVM) is a computer program that simulates shifts in potential vegetation and its associated biogeochemical and hydrological cycles as a response to shifts in climate. DGVMs use time series of climate data and, given constraints of latitude, topography, and soil characteristics, simulate monthly or daily dynamics of ecosystem processes. DGVMs are used most often to simulate the effects of future climate change on natural vegetation and its carbon and water cycles (Wikipedia 2021).

### Processes

They are a key component because we are focusing on process-based models in this course. There is a long list of processes (energy, water, turbulent transport, canopy scaling, carbon, nitrogen, trace gasses, demography,…) that the models integrate, especially the more complex ones. These processes will be discussed in detail in the following theory chapters and we will mainly focus on how to translate them into equations.

### Equations

These are the mathematical representations of the processes. However, there are important constraints to insert  equations into a vegetation model, such as the specific time scale at which a process operates. For example, it makes little sense to resolve the equation for forest composition (succession) on a daily calculation time step. This is a prolonged process with an extremely low variance between consecutive days. The solution for the equation for photosynthesis, on the other hand, varies significantly throughout the day and between consecutive days (cloudy day vs sunny day).

There are three types of equations within vegetation models: 
- **prognostic equations**: time derivatives of differential equations – they calculate the state's change over time
- **conservation equations**: equations describing the conservation of mass and energy
- **diagnostic equations**: linking multiple variables independent from the time. 
Often there is no analytical solution of the equations describing on-linear processes in biological systems; therefore, we must use numerical methods to solve the equations.


### Parameters

These are the constants in the model. Some parameters are highly uncertain because we can not measure them very well at the relevant scale. For example, we can make reliable measurements of the photosynthetic capacity of a single leaf. However, upscaling this parameter so that it is applicable for a forest or multiple PFTs (plant functional types) induces uncertainty. The more parameters a model uses, the more uncertainties that are to be taken into account.

### Time Steps

Vegetation models run at multiple timescales (combining processes that are resolved at multiple timescales). Models present fast processes, which are calculated every hour (e.g. photosynthesis and energy balance), intermediate processes calculated daily (e.g. carbon allocation and growth) and slow processes in order of years (e.g. mortality) (Fig.6).  

```{r f9, fig.cap='Structure of a vegatation model indicating the different time steps at which each process is simulated (Williams et al. 2009)', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/chap1/time_steps.png')
```

### Spatial structure

The division of space in voxels, layers or grid cells and its resolution determines how many times we repeat our calculations in space. Global vegetation models have a typical spatial grid of 100km or even more and divide the landscape into patches. In each patch, they simulate the vegetation (forest, savannas, grassland…). Models also have a horizontal grid or horizontal layering: some models consider multiple soil layers. The same is true for above ground layers, where some models divide the canopy into multiple layers (Figure \@ref(fig:f10)). 
For example, the Ecosystem Demography Model (ED2.2) divides the forest into multiple grid cells where the same meteorological conditions apply within each grid cell. Then within each cell, this model has different sites with different soils. Each site is divided into multiple patches (forests with a similar disturbance history). For each patch, the model simulates multiple cohorts of trees (Figure \@ref(fig:f11)).

knitr::include_graphics('figures/chap1/grid_ED2.png')
```

### Model code, complexity and uncertainty

There is a gap between equations and how the are implemented in the actual model code. Also, a specific process can be implemented into an equation in various ways. Usually, large models also contain a "technical debt", which means over the years, multiple modelers have continued working on models and added code lines, but at some point, the code is so large that none of the developers still knows the entire code, resulting in persistent bugs or overlooked assumptions. 

Models are always a simplification of the real world, but they tend to become overly complex

More complex models (adding more processes) become more realistic, but we also add more sources of uncertainty. Therefore, we should choose our model carefully based on the research question we want to adress.

### Data

It is not possible to develop models without data. In general, the more data (multiple data sources), the better.

## Modelling workflow and structure of the course

Vegetation modelling is a multidisciplinary field. This course will mainly focus on the mathematical formulation of processes and translating these equations into a working model.

```

The construction of a model is a continuous process – a model is never finished. As Figure 10 shows us, we start by describing our system in the form of equations, then running the computer program to characterize the model, perform parameter estimation and interpretation, and then apply it to other locations and validate against independent data.
