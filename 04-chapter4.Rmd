The median timing of the onset of leaf senescence and turnover is indicated for each species. Species-specific bootstrapped 95%-confidence intervals are indicated with a line segment. Species are arranged according to the variability in the timing of the phenophase, with species with the lowest uncertainty at the outer edge and continuing towards the center. Species with an annual (full circles) or sub-annual (crosses) fourier-based seasonality are indicated. Grey shaded areas represent the average timing of the long and short dry seasons (LD and SD; monthly precipitation < 150 mm), separated by the long and short wet seasons (LW and SW).
