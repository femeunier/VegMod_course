## Crop phenology
<!-- UCL 4.5.1 -->
Definition +Simple example of phenology (wheat for example: germination + spread + full coverage + allocation to storage organs + ripening)

## Phenology
<!-- UCL 4.5.2 -->
Broader sense of phenology.
Applies to most plant. Circadian to seasonal cycles
Tissue turnover and senescence

## Mechanisms of phenology and evidence of changes
<!-- UCL 4.5.3 -->
<!-- temperature  -->
<!-- light  -->
<!-- water -->
<!-- Drivers of seasonality and phenology -->
<!-- Vegeation index and changes over time -->

## Models of phenology
<!-- UCL 4.5.4 -->
<!-- budburst models  -->
<!-- senescence models -->
<!-- Phenology in DGVMs -->
<!-- Figures from Zhang et al. 2003 -->
