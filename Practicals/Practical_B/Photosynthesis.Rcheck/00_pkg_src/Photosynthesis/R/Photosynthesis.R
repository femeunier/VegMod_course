#' Photosynthesis
#' @description This function compute photosynthesis based on the FvCB model for carbon assimilation and the
#' Ball and Berry model for stomatal conductance and inputs from FLUXNET data
#'
#' It uses an iterative approach. Analytical solutions exists, however using the iterative approach will help you
#' to make the link with the FvCB.model function that was created during Practical_A
#' @param meteo List of meteorological variables TA in Â°C, CO2 in ppm, SW in W m-2, RH in %, PA in Pa
#' @param leaf List of leaf physiological parameters
#' @param physcon List of physical constants
#' @param LAI_layer Number of LAI layers to compute photosynthesise, default = 10
#'
#' This parameter will define the extinction of light into the canopy.
#' If LAI_layer = 1, all leaves are considered top sun exposed leaves and will receive all the light.
#' @param LAI_tot Total LAI at site in m2/m2
#'
#' @return Return a list with GPP and ET estimated at the canopy level
