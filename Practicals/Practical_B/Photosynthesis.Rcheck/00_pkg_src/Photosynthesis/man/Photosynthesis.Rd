\usage{
Photosynthesis(meteo, leaf, physcon, LAI_layer = 10, LAI_tot = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{meteo}{List of meteorological variables TA in Â°C, CO2 in ppm, SW in W m-2, RH in %, PA in Pa}

\item{leaf}{List of leaf physiological parameters}

\item{physcon}{List of physical constants}

\item{LAI_layer}{Number of LAI layers to compute photosynthesise, default = 10

This parameter will define the extinction of light into the canopy.
If LAI_layer = 1, all leaves are considered top sun exposed leaves and will receive all the light.}

\item{LAI_tot}{Total LAI at site in m2/m2}
}
\value{
Return a list with GPP and ET estimated at the canopy level
}
\description{
This function compute photosynthesis based on the FvCB model for carbon assimilation and the
Ball and Berry model for stomatal conductance and inputs from FLUXNET data

It uses an iterative approach. Analytical solutions exists, however using the iterative approach will help you
to make the link with the FvCB.model function that was created during Practical_A
