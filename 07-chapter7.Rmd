```{r f72, fig.cap='Arnold’s (1983) framework revisited in a plant ecology perspective. Morpho-physio-phenological (M-P-P) traits (from 1 to k) modulate one or all three performance traits (vegetative biomass, reproductive output and plant survival) which determine plant performance and, in fine, its individual fitness. M-P-P traits may be inter-related (dashed double-arrows). For clarity, interrelations among performance traits and feedbacks between performance and M-P-P traits are not represented.

Any morphological, physiological or phenological feature measurable at the individual level, from the cell to the whole-organism level, without reference to the environment or any other level of organization. 
It is functional if it affects fitness indirectly via its effects on growth, reproduction and survival.


```{r f73, fig.cap='Pathways linking the challenge of interest of different organizational levels, through their related inherent components, to some examples of traits found in the literature. Without trait-based information, scaling-up to higher organizational levels needs complex integration information (I). Thus fitness components of an individual determine the components of the finite rate of increase (lambda) of the population (Ii-p). Occurrence and frequency of species at the community level encompass components of lambda through complex integration (e.g. biotic interactions) (Ip-c). Finally, scaling-up to ecosystem properties can be done by combining functional property of each species of the community (Ic-e). Using traits as proxies of a process at a particular organizational level can sometimes be done without such integration function. For example, at the ecosystem level, ecosystem productivity (one component of ecosystem functioning) shows a strong positive relationship with plant height (an effect trait) (Saugier et al. 2001; Violle et al. 2007)', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center',echo=FALSE}

```{r f78, fig.cap='Environmental filtering in relation to other community assembly processes in the context of species abundance changes across an environmental gradient. Firstly, a species may be absent from a focal site on the gradient because of dispersal limitation. Next, environmental filtering (sensu stricto) occurs when a species arrives at a focal site but fails to establish or persist with neighbours removed. Competitive exclusion occurs when a species arrives and can persist in the absence of neighbours but not in their presence. Finally, at a different focal site, within‐site abiotic heterogeneity (not typically defined as environmental filtering) can contribute to the ability of community members to persist locally. Note that in this hypothetical example, the observed pattern of species abundance shifts across the gradient emerges from the combined action of all four processes.

## Limitations of the PFT concept

## Alternative approaches to account for trait variability

```{r f717, fig.cap='Conceptual modelling framework for a next-generation dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM). Individuals are characterized by their traits that influence their carbon (C) status and phenotype. All individuals at a site form the community, which influences resources, environmental conditions and disturbances via engineering and modulating impacts. These conditions interact to influence growth of the individuals. Individuals, through reproduction, can add their traits to the community trait pool. Crossover and mutation of the community trait pool yield the community seed bank. PDF, probability density function.

```{r f718, fig.cap='Physio–demo–genetic (PDG) models integrate physiological, demographic, and evolutionary processes. They have been developed to better understand the interplay among plasticity and genetic adaptation and the effects of both processes on tree population dynamics under global change. The advantage of PDG models is their ability to account for the variability in functional traits due to both standing genetic variation and evolutionary change in response to changing local environmental conditions. This figure shows the conceptual framework of PDGmodels. PDGmodels couple: (i) a biophysical module to simulate carbon and water fluxes at the tree level using climate observations; (ii) a forest dynamics module to calculate demographic rates for adult trees (growth, mortality, and reproduction) based on carbohydrate reserves, and to simulate ecological processes across the life cycle; and, (iii) a quantitative genetics module relating genotype to the phenotype of one or more functional traits.

```{r f719, fig.cap='Framework for the use of organizing principles in vegetation modelling. The application of organizing principles (circles) helps predict (arrows) vegetation properties (boxes). Natural selection drives the evolution of species (or plant types) and their heritable functional traits, modelled as emergent evolutionairy stable strategies. Natural selection is also the reason that phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental variation is predictable through fitness-proxy maximization (optimality). At the community level, collective self-organization among many plants results in predictable patterns of spatial structure at the stand level (for example, due to plasticity of stem angles in the perfect plasticity approximation). Self-organization influences the biotic environment, which, together with the abiotic (external) environment, feeds back on plant reproduction and survival—that is, the natural selection of community composition. Many different community compositions may be possible, and the most likely can be predicted by MaxEnt. The external environment includes abiotic factors and all other external drivers, including disturbance regimes. (Franklin et al. 2020)', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center',echo=FALSE}
