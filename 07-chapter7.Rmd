## Introduction

## Functional diversity

Any morphological, physiological or phenological feature measurable at the individual level, from the cell to the whole-organism level, without reference to the environment or any other level of organization. 
It is functional if it affects fitness indirectly via its effects on growth, reproduction and survival.
