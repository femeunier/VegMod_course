# (PART) Biophysical and physiological models {-}
<!-- We could buid a schematic of what is a vegetation model throughout the course, starting with independent boxes that we link together as we upscale the processes?  -->

# Modelling plant basic processes
\chaptermark{photsynthesis}

**For all processes, we provide an overview of existing models and approaches and we will detail only one of them for the practical course. This also apply for the other chapters, the idea of the course is to be more conceptual about how we model vegetation and the different applications and assumptions.**

- Canopy integration: LAI layers, etc... Nice transition to chap 3 with the interception of light by the canopy
