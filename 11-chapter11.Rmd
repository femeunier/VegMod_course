# Model projections and scenario analysis
\chaptermark{Projections}
<!-- Not in UCL -->
<!-- How is it used? By who? Not only policies (IPCC) but several applications.  -->

## Climate scenarios
<!-- - How is it defined?  -->
<!-- - Earth system models -->
<!-- - ENSEMBLE simulations, importance of experiments for historical and future simulation assessement (FLUXNET, paleo-climat, FACE, remote-sensing, etcâ€¦) -->

## Land-use scenarios
- Hyde for historical land-use, https://themasites.pbl.nl/tridion/en/themasites/hyde/
- Scenario for future land-use

## Management scenarios

## Some concrete applications of vegetation models
- As a conclusion ? gives example of models and applications other than IPCC and climate change?
