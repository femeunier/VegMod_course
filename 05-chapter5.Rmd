## Carbon cycle models: stocks and fluxes


This chapter will develop the ecological foundation and mathematics to describe ecosystem carbon dynamics using biogeochemical models.
Biogeochemical models abstract an ecosystem as pools of carbon and the flows of carbon among these pools.

Biogeochemical models simulate processes of allocation of photosynthetic carbon gain to plant parts (e.g., foliage, fine root, wood), turnover of plant biomass as litterfall, transformation of litter to soil organic matter, and carbon loss during respiration.

Principles: 
- net carbon input is equal to gross primary production minus autotrophic respiration;
- carbon flows from donor to receiver pools at a rate that depends on the donor pool size and its chemical quality as modified by the environment;
- mass balance is maintained as carbon flows through the system of interconnected pools;
- decay of litter and soil organic matter releases CO 2 as heterotrophic respiration.

Models:
a system of first-order, linear differential equations to describe carbon pools and fluxes (typically time step of one day)

Pools and fluxes to be included:
- Carbon gain from gross primary production  minus autotrophic respiration
- Allocation of carbon to growth of leaves, wood, and roots pools (partitioning varies with light availability, soil temperature, soil moisture, and nutrients + temporal for leaves (ref to phenology)
- Carbon turnover (comprising litterfall, background mortality, and disturbances) + turnover rates depending on the plant material
- litter pools: metabolic litter, structural litter, coarse woody debris (vary in chemical quality and turnover rate; base turnover rates are modified for soil temperature and soil moisture (environmental scaling factors))
- decomposition to soil organic matter pools: fast SOM, slow SOM, passive SOM (vary in chemical quality and turnover time)
- portion of the decomposition flow lost as heterotrophic respiration

## Carbon allocation models

- allocation parameters
- fixed allocation and dynamic allocation (specified by biome or based on environmental conditions)
- Optimality models: plants optimally allocate resources to balance light acquisition (foliage), structural support and water transport (stems), and water and nutrient uptake (roots).
- allocation based on scaling relationships among plant components (specified ratios of foliage, root, and wood biomass)

- Turnover rates vary depending on plant material and are specified as a fraction of biomass.
- Turnover rates are commonly estimated as the inverse of residence time or longevity

-  biogeochemical models can be applied to any type of ecosystem such as grassland, savanna, forest, shrubland, and tundra

Shown are litter flux partitioning parameters bij, base decomposition rates kii (per year), fractional carbon transfer fij, and respiration fraction rij. Solid lines indicate decomposition pathways, with curved arrows denoting heterotrophic respiration fluxes for each pathway. DAYCENT allows for photodegradation from solar radiation, but that was not included in Bonan et al. (2013). Nor was leaching loss included. (a) Leaves decompose as surface material represented by two litter pools and two organic matter pools (shown on the left). Fine roots decompose as belowground material represented by two litter pools and three organic matter pools (shown on the right). The actual decomposition rate varies with soil temperature T, soil moisture θ, and pH. Belowground decomposition additionally varies with anaerobic conditions (O2), cultivation, and soil texture. Structural litter decomposition also depends on lignin fraction flig. The total turnover of the surface slow pool depends on decomposition and mixing, with a fraction to the belowground slow pool and the remainder to the surface active pool.

### NUtrient cycle models

- similar to carbon with an associated nitrogen pool and transfer.
- cycling of nitrogen can be represented by a system of linear differential equations similar to that for carbon.

- allocation of plant nitrogen uptake  up to plant pools
- loss of nitrogen in litterfall +  portion is reabsorbed

- soil nitrogen cycle is more complex (various forms)
- decomposition of litter and soil organic matter, (mineralization and immobilization)
- nitrification, denitrification, leaching, ammonia volatilization

- additional inputs from biological nitrogen fixation, atmospheric deposition, and fertilizer

## Water balance models

- focus on the surface energy balance and vertical water movement in the soil–plant atmosphere system (e.g., soil moisture control of evapotranspiration)

- Specific components in terrestrial biosphere models:  
Interception, throughfall, stemflow, infiltration, surface runoff, soil water redistribution, subsurface runoff, snow melt, evaporation, transpiration, plant water uptake, stomatal conductance
