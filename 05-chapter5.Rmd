# (PART) Modelling vegetation dynamics {-}

# Modelling growth, timber production and Carbon allocation
\chaptermark{Growth}
<!-- UCL 4.2.2 -->

## Empirical growth modelling: growth curves
<!-- short, link with inventory course -->

## Process-based growth modelling: C-allocation models
<!-- - C pools: Allocation to leaf, wood, fruit -->
<!-- - types of allocation models (see Campioli et al 2013 and work of Fatichi et al. ) -->

Suggestion to change chapter:
- both empirical and process-based growth modelling are addressed in detail in Chapters 6 and 7
- in Chapter 1, I would describe the difference between empirical and process-based modelling (including semi-empirical), and remove the specifics of empirical vs process-based growth here
